# Welcome to the Gatsby User Collective!

The Gatsby UC was born out of a desire to create higher quality plugins in the Gatsby ecosystem by reducing maintainer work loads. 

## Goals

Most Gatsby plugin projects aren't massive. Sometimes they need regular maintenance, a lot of the time they do not. Either way, original authors become unable or willing to maintain a plugin at any given moment or maybe indefinately. This is not a comdemnation, it's a fact of life that sometimes maintainers need to move on. No matter the cause, this results in plugins going un-maintained by their authors. Others are willing and able to help; but the bottle neck that cannot be bypassed. At times this means fixing bugs in less ideal ways, creating duplicate implementations of plugins, etc. The Gatsby User collective's goal is to demorcratize the maintenance of these plugins to allow more folks to assist in their maintenance.
